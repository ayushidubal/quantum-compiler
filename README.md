# quantum-compiler

This is my application to the QOSF mentorship program. I have completed task 3. 

I have built a simple quantum compiler that supports single qubit gates and multi-controlled versions of single qubit gates.
I hope to expand this in the future by adding parametric gates and even finding ways to optimise the circuit.
